## Introduction

This tutorial provides a comprehensive walkthrough on how to build a **Java Chess Game Application**. The focus is on helping beginners understand Java’s core features by implementing a functional chess game with essential game logic, UI components, and interactive features. Whether you are just beginning with Java or looking to develop a portfolio project, this chess game is an engaging way to learn!

## Features

The Java Chess Game Application includes the following features:

1. **User Interface Design**: Create an intuitive and visually appealing UI using Java Swing.
2. **Game Logic Implementation**: Handle chess rules, including legal moves, turn switching, check, and checkmate conditions.
3. **Interactive Chessboard**: Dynamically update piece positions and board layout in response to player actions.
4. **Advanced Gameplay Features**:
   - Highlight legal moves for selected pieces.
   - Implement a reset option to restart the game.
   - Provide real-time feedback for check and checkmate states.

By following this tutorial and using the source code provided, you’ll be able to expand upon these features or modify the game for your own learning purposes.

## Project Prerequisites

To make the most of this tutorial, it helps to have the following skills:

- **Basic Java Knowledge**: Familiarity with Java syntax and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as classes, objects, methods, and inheritance.
- **Game Programming Concepts**: An understanding of game loops, state management, and event handling will be beneficial.
- **JavaFX and Swing**: Basic knowledge of JavaFX for UI development; this tutorial will provide guidance, so beginners are welcome!

## Getting Started

To get started with building your own Java chess game, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GN-SR/JavaChessGame.git
    cd JavaChessGame
    ```
2. **Set Up Your Development Environment**:
   - Make sure you have the latest version of Java installed (Java 8 or higher is recommended).
   - Use an IDE of your choice (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) for an optimal development experience.

## Installation

1. **Open the Project in Your IDE**: 
   Open the cloned repository in your preferred IDE.
   
2. **Compile and Run**: 
   Build the project, compile the code, and run the application to see the chess game in action.

3. **Run with Command Line (Optional)**:
    ```bash
    javac src/*.java
    java src.Main
    ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can:

- **Play a Chess Game**: Move pieces by clicking on them and selecting a valid destination.
- **Highlight Legal Moves**: Click on a piece to see all possible moves.
- **Reset the Game**: Use the reset button to start a new game anytime.
- **Check and Checkmate Feedback**: Receive real-time notifications when a check or checkmate occurs.

This game can be played in a local, turn-based mode. It does not support network play or AI opponents at this stage.

And this project is still in progress
